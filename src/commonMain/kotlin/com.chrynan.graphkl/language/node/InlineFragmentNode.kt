/**
 * A [Node] representing a GraphQL inline fragment from a [Source]. For example, consider the following GraphQL query:
 *
 * hero(episode: $ep) {
 *     name
 *     ... on Human {
 *         height
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * In the above query, the following section is an inline fragment:
 *
 * ... on Human {
 *     height
 * }
 *
 * An inline fragment begins with the spread operator ('...'), followed by the 'on' keyword, then the type name that the
 * fragment will operator on ('Human'), and finally, the fields of that type that this query will return. This [Node]
 * defines that whole sequence. The [typeCondition] represents the the type that the fragment will operate on, including
 * the fields which the query will return.
